# sudoku-solver

Hey! This code finally works! Isn't that exciting, it can now make and solve sudoku puzzles. If you want to use all of these features try this line `solvePuzzle(puzzlefy(randomPlacer(9), 40))`. This'll create a random puzzle and then delete 40 of those numbers and then, wait for it, it will solve the puzzle. It only took me a couple of weeks to make :). Enjoy!

Feel free to contact me with any questions!
