# sudoku-solver

Hey! This is a fun little project I decided to use just test my TypeScript skills. It doesn't work perfectly but it's not awful right now it just needs some work. If you have any suggestions for me just put it in the issues! If you want to reach out to me you can just look at my personal readme for more info!
