# sudoku-solver

Hey! So unfortunatly this code does not yet solve sudoku but it does create sudoku puzzles. If you want to use one you need to call `randomPlacer()` with an argument of 9. Then call `puzzlefy()` with a first argument of the puzzle that you just made and a second argument of how many blank spots you want. Feel free to contact me with any questions!
