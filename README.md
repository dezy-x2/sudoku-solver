# sudoku-solver

Hey! So this code unfortunatly does not yet solve sudodu problems but it is getting very close to being able to solve them there just one weird bug I still need to figure out in `solver()`. If you want to use one you need to call `randomPlacer()` with an argument of 9. Then call `puzzlefy()` with a first argument of the puzzle that you just made and a second argument of how many blank spots you want. Feel free to contact me with any questions!
